\title{ENMnullSims statistics plot}
\usage{
evalplot.nulls(e.null, stats, plot.type)
}
\arguments{
\item{e.null}{ENMnull object}

\item{stats}{Character vector of statistics from results table to be plotted; if more than
one statistic is specified, the histogram plot will be faceted}

\item{plot.type}{Character specifying the plot type: either "violin" or "histogram"}
}
\value{
A ggplot of null model statistics.
}
\description{
Plot histogram of evaluation statistics for null ENM simulations
}
\details{
There are two variations for this plot, but both show null quantiles (0.01, 0.05, 0.5, 0.95, 0.99). 
For violin plots, the null distribution is displayed as a vertical shape (i.e., the violin) with horizontal lines showing 
the quantiles and the real value is plotted as a red point along the vertical axis. 
For histogram plots, the null distribution is displayed as a histogram with vertical lines showing the quantiles 
and the real value as a vertical red line on the distribution.
