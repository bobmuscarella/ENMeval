\title{Calculate AICc from Maxent model prediction}
\usage{
aic.maxent(p.occs, nparams, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p.occs}{data frame of raw (maxent.jar) or exponential (maxnet) predictions for
the occurrence localities based on one or more models}

\item{p}{Raster* of raw (maxent.jar) or exponential (maxnet) model predictions;
if NULL, AICc will be calculated based on the background points, which already
have predictions that sum to 1 and thus need no correction -- this assumes that
the background points represent a good sample of the study extent}

\item{nparam}{integer; number of model parameters (non-zero coefficients)}
}
\value{
data frame with three columns:
\code{AICc} is the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample
sizes calculated as:
\deqn{ (2 * K - 2 * logLikelihood) + (2 * K) * (K+1) / (n - K - 1)}
where \emph{K} is the number of parameters in the model (i.e., number of
non-zero parameters) and \emph{n} is the number of
occurrence localities.  The \emph{logLikelihood} is calculated as:
\deqn{ sum(log(vals))}
where \emph{vals} is a vector of Maxent raw/expontential values at occurrence localities
and the sum of these values across the study extent is equal to 1.
\code{delta.AICc} is the difference between the AICc of a given model and
the AICc of the model with the lowest AICc.
\code{w.AICc} is the Akaike weight (calculated as the relative likelihood of
a model (exp(-0.5 * \code{delta.AICc})) divided by the sum of the likelihood
values of all models included in a run.  These can be used for model
averaging (Burnham and Anderson 2002).

\description{
This function calculates AICc for Maxent models based on Warren 
and Seifert (2011).
}
\details{
As motivated by Warren and Seifert (2011) and implemented in 
ENMTools (Warren  \emph{et al.} 2010), this function calculates the small 
sample size version of Akaike Information Criterion for ENMs (Akaike 1974).  
We use AICc (instead of AIC) regardless of sample size based on the 
recommendation of Burnham and Anderson (1998, 2004).  The number of 
parameters is determined by counting the number of non-zero parameters in 
the \code{maxent} lambda file (\code{m@lambdas} for maxent.jar and \code{m$betas} for maxnet.  
See Warren \emph{et al.} (2014) for limitations of this approach, namely that the number of parameters is an 
estimate of the true degrees of freedom.  For Maxent ENMs, AICc is 
calculated by standardizing the raw output such that all cells in the study 
extent sum to 1. The likelihood of the data for a given model is then 
calculated by taking the product of the raw output values (or the sum of their logs, as is implemented here)
for all grid cells that contain an occurrence locality (Warren and Seifert 2011).

\note{
Returns all \code{NA}s if the number of parameters is larger than the
number of observations (occurrence localities).
