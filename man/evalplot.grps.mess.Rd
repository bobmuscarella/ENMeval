\title{MESS plots for partition groups}
\usage{
evalplot.grps.mess(e, envs, pts.type = "occs", plot.type = "density")
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{ENMevaluation object}

\item{envs}{RasterStack of environmental predictor variables used to build the models in "e"; categorical variables should be 
removed before input, as they cannot be used to calculate MESS}

\item{pts.type}{Character specifying which to calculate MESS based on: occurrences ("occs") or background ("bg"), with default "occs"}

\item{plot.type}{Character specifying which to plot: MESS density curves ("density") or MESS rasters ("raster")}
}
\value{
A ggplot of MESS calculations for data partitions.
}
\description{
Plot multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) estimates of test occurrences on the study extent 
by partition group with density curves or rasters
}
\details{
There are two variations for this plot. If "density", density curves are plotted showing the MESS estimates for each partition group. 
If "raster", rasters are plotted showing the geographical MESS estimates for each partition group. 
As implemented here, MESS calculates the similarity between environmental values associated with the 
test occurrences (per partition group) and those associated with the entire study extent (specified by the extent 
of the input RasterStack "envs"). Higher negative values indicate greater environmental difference between the test occurrences
and the study extent, and higher positive values indicate greater similarity. This function uses the `dismo::mess()` function 
to calculate MESS. See the below reference for more details.
